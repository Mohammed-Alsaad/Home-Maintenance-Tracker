## Installation
 ```
 npm install 
 ```
### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository** (or navigate to the project directory)

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm run install-all
   ```
   This will install dependencies for both the server and client.

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   PORT=5000
   JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production

   # Email Configuration (Optional - for email reminders)
   # If not set, reminders will be logged to console only
   SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
   SMTP_PORT=587
   SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
   SMTP_PASS=your-app-password
   SMTP_FROM=noreply@homemaintenance.com
   ```

   **Note**: For Gmail, you'll need to use an [App Password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833) instead of your regular password.

4. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This starts both the backend server (port 5000) and the React frontend (port 3000).

   Or run them separately:
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1 - Backend
   npm run server

   # Terminal 2 - Frontend
   npm run client
   ```

5. **Access the application**:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - Backend API: http://localhost:5000

## Usage

1. **Create an Account**: Sign up with your email, name, and home type
2. **Add Tasks**: Click "Add Task" to create maintenance tasks manually
3. **Get Suggestions**: Click "Get Suggestions" to see recommended tasks based on your home type
4. **View Dashboard**: See all your tasks organized by status
5. **Complete Tasks**: Mark tasks as complete when finished
6. **Set Reminders**: Tasks with due dates will automatically trigger email reminders 3 days before they're due
